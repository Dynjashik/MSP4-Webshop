## Purpose and Motivation
There is a huge amount of toy shop out there, both online and physical ones. Most of them have a very broad spectrum of products for all kind of usages and ages. It can get very confusing when you look for something specific, especially if you just became a parent or want to buy something as a present. That's why I saw a need to start a store specifically with products for babies under 1 year old, because it is not 100% clear what toys & accessories are fit for such fragile children. In addition I came up with an unusual categories for such shop, that would filter products by baby's skills and environment where products can be used.

The website has clear and simple design that allows users to quickly navigate and search the products. While adding products to a shopping bag the total cost will update dynamically and the user can easily track his upcoming expenses. Afterwards the user can procced to the check-out page where he can make a payment and complete an order. The order confirmation & details will be sent to the user's email.

Website admins (or superusers) has access to extended rights & functionality: manage products, news blog and contact requests.
